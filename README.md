# web-design-challenge
This repository contains all the necessary components for a website displaying an analysis of data taken from the OpenWeather API on 4/11/2022. It contains an index page with an overall objective of the project and plots for all 4 of the factors studied for correlation with latitude (these 4 factors being max temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed). Each of these plots is interactive and leads to a visualization page with analysis for each respective factor. A comparison page is included displaying the 4 plots next to each other. And finally a data table is included showing the data of each city that was used in the project.
